# Cows_Bulls_Chickens
This project is a take on the classic game Cows and Bulls called Cows, Bulls, and Chickens. In this game, the user has to guess a four digit number from using the Cows, Bulls, and Chickens cues in a specific number of tries. The aim of this project is to minimize the number of tries required to guess the correct number.
